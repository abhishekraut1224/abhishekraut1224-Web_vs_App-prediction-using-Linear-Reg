# Linear Regression Training Project: Ecommerce Clients
In this project, we suppose that the company is trying to decide whether to focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website. We are here to help them make a data-driven decision.

## Dataset Overview
Avg. Session Length: Average session length of in-store style advice sessions.
Time on App: Average time spent on App in minutes
Time on Website: Average time spent on Website in minutes
Length of Membership: How many years has the customer been a member?
Yearly Amount Spent: The total amount the customer spends on the platform.

To understand customer behavior, we used the following visualizations:

Jointplot: Analyzes the relationship between two variables.
Pairplot: Shows relationships between multiple variables using pairwise scatter plots.
LMplot (Linear Model Plot): Displays linear regression lines for different groups.

## Conclusion
Our analysis revealed that customers tend to spend more time using the mobile app but do not make as many purchases compared to the website. This suggests that the online store may have usability issues, such as a lack of a seamless purchase process, which could be affecting conversions. Improvements in the websiteâ€™s design and user experience might help increase sales and customer engagement.
